#This main.py script serves as the central controller for the automated toilet seat project. 
# It integrates inputs from both a PIR sensor and a seat pressure switch with actuator control through a servo and provides audio feedback via a speaker. 
# Upon startup, the script plays a series of tones and performs an initial test by opening and closing the seat. 
# During operation, it continuously polls the PIR sensor, and once motion is detected, 
# it triggers the servo to open the seat and then waits for user interaction via the seat switchâ€”first detecting when someone sits down and then when they stand up. 
# After these inputs, it plays another tone and incorporates delays before closing the seat. 
# In summary, this code orchestrates sensor readings, mechanical seat movements, and sound signals to provide a seamless, automated toilet seat experience.
